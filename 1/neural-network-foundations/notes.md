# Perceptron

Originally, the perceptron was designed to take a number of binary inputs and produce one binary output.

However, if an input was only represented by `1`s and `0`s, it would be difficult to determine which input is more important than the others.

The idea was to use different **weights** to represent the importance of each input. The sum of these weighted values should be greater than a set **threshold** value before making a decision (output).
