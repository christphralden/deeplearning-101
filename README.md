# Deep Learning

### Neural Network From Scratch (NNFS)

Creating a neural network purely with numpy. So every the implementation of every building block inside a nerural network is clear based on theory provided.

### Sessions

- **Code** : Contains code for each session
- **Notes** : Contains notes as the prerequisite to understanding the implementation of the code

### Architectures

The implementation of various deep learning architectures
